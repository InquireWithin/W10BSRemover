Changes prior to 30/4/22 are undocumented
First created 13/4/22

Working on (as of 20/5/22)
more 'stable' execution
Service digging
reg key digging
sch tasks digging
reversal script
remove more conflicting lines of code in 3rd party scripts
logfile (either by default or command line argument)
integrate cmd_server_list.bat into ms_telemetry_list.txt
try calling the req'd files (except the telemetry list) synchronously via '&'
add command line args for silent,verbose, logging, gutjob, autorun
FIX command line argument problem
ensure service can run and with system permissions (otherwise try to start the service as a powershell file)

25/5/22 [v2.4.1 STABLE]
- Removed pointless service creation (batch files can no longer be ran as services)
+ Hopefully fixed disabling of Windows Defender
+ Fixed curl request for the hosts file
+ extra points in the in-file documentation
+ Hopefully removed the Xbox Game Bar

25/5/22 [2.4 mostlystable] The most stable version in a while
"commented" indiana jones style swaps of systemapps
a lot more reg key patches
extended route table filter
extended ms telemetry list
housecleaning
hopefully a fix for the gamebar ms-overlay bug (if not i will implement the registry solution)
removal of live kernel logs to free storage
Local packages and local package cache are no longer removed by default
partial debloating of edge (shouldnt be using edge anyway but I do it because you "have to" use it prior to getting an alternative)
Eliminating OfficeClickToRun.exe and its related svc
services added for removal by default: TapiSrv, WdiServiceHost, WinDefend, WdNisSvc, SecurityHealthService, ClickToRunSvc, OneSynSvc, DeviceAssociationService, DoSvc, wuausrv
added some additional optional services to delete (commented, uncomment them to include)
Disabling Windows Defender
optional (commented) directories to remove for services a user may not use (like teams, office, etc)
added some firewall rules for certain systemapp non-removable binaries that should never be making outbound requests
and more removal of modern computing horrors beyond my comprehension
any bugs that could come w/ this patch can be resolved with sfc /scannow in an admin command prompt.

"mostlystable" turned out to be flat out wrong. do NOT use 2.3.
* 20/5/22 [2.3 mostlystable]
"indiana jones" marble swaps on the systemapp provisioned packages w/ respective taskkills prior so processes cant launch again from there
lots of more low hanging spyware removed
couple of "guards" in place
KillerNetwork spyware engine removed
discontinued usage of the forked W10Debloater file (for now) (W10Debloater.ps1) due to incompatibility and bugs caused by subsequent windows updates
cleared local package cache
Microsoft\Windows\SettingSync\BackgroundUploadTask  <- remove this w/ a bit change, couldnt find original forum post where the reg file to do this is
removed invalid requests resulting in an error that slowed execution by >2 seconds
optimizations
updated readme for new additions, most notably added section "Limitations"
startup is now a delayed-auto service instead of tied to the regkey, this likely wont work though as batch files havent been known to be compatible with microsoft's "modern" service manager

18/5/22 [2.21 semistable]
no longer any need for user input except for explorer restart
changed order of execution so all (debloat related) batch code finishes prior to powershell script call

17/5/22 ["2.2" SEMISTABLE]
command line args fixed (log is still awkward though as you cant see why its paused, wouldnt recommend using)
startup regkey fixed
powershell call to W10Debloater finally patched (though many errors occur due to Microsoft removing the ability to manually remove the packages)
W10Debloater.ps1 has self-elevation now
cleaned up user input interface that was taking up space
cleaned some commenting
removed a couple conflicting statements

17/5/22 ["2.1" SEMISTABLE]
added UAC prompt if script is launched without admin
added command line arguments but they dont function as intended (yet)
added the deletion of all content delivery files (irreversible)
added all ip's in cmd_server_list.bat to ms_telemetry_list.txt (finally)
deleted cmd_server_list.bat
uploaded part of reversal script to main repo (still needs to be tweaked)

13/5/22? 
Completely reformed and reworked the README.md

2/5/22 ["2.01" STABLE]
removed a line of code causing an instant crash
added a mediocre changelog
changed file extension of cmd_server_list.txt to .bat
changed file extensions of required forked repo files to bat or ps1 
adjusted curl statements for above changes
local file support. Network conenction is no longer a requirement if the files are downloaded in advance.
removed inconsistencies in file naming schema
all req'd files are now in one repo
updated README

1/5/22 ["2.0-UNSTABLE"](changes made here are mainly unstable and mostly untested as my vm setup is down due to formatting of the disk intentionally)
attempted integration with forked W10Debloater
removed cortana removal restraint from alchemy1's script (forked, untested)
removed a few needless lines in forked repos that will perform actions already done and slow down execution.
30/4/22
removed user interaction CLI (better to just let the script run and allow easier integration into other scripts)
allowed integration w/ alchemy 1 script
removed loose lines of code and directed it to a file, now curled
forked alchemy1's debloat script and Sycrex's W10Debloater, changes are on their respective repos.

2/5/22 ("2.1"-stable)
combined RemoveW10Bloat.bat and main script
backup of host file before breaking
logic changes
a few more static ip blocks
